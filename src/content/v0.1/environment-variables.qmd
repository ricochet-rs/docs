title: "Environment variables"

Environment variables are key-value pairs that can be used to customize behavior at runtime.

During development you may use a `.Renviron` or `.env` file to keep track of secrets. These files **should not** be deployed alongside your content item. Instead, set environment in the `ricochet` UI. Note that environment variables are encrypted at rest and only decrypted before starting an R or Julia process.

To add environment variables navigate to your content item's setting page at `https://ricochet.rs/content/{ID}/settings/env`. The `Key` is the name of the environment variable. `Value` is the value of the environment variable. Press save after adding new environment variables.

The new environment variables will be available to any new processes.

## Accessing environment variables

To access environment variables in R, use `Sys.getenv("KEY_NAME")`. Or in Julia, access them via the built in dictionary `ENV["KEY_NAME"]`
