title: The ricochet CLI

import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The ricochet CLI is a Rust-based command-line tool for deploying and managing content on ricochet servers.
It provides an interactive interface for creating, updating, and monitoring your deployments.

## Installation

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Mac / Linux">
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricochet-rs/cli/main/install.sh | sh
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">
```bash
curl.exe -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricochet-rs/cli/main/install.ps1 -o install.ps1; .\install.ps1; Remove-Item install.ps1
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation:

```bash
ricochet --version
```

### Homebrew (macOS)

For macOS, we also provide a Homebrew formula:

```sh
brew tap ricochet-rs/homebrew-tap
brew install ricochet
```

### Windows

<Aside type="tip">A Scoop formula is planned but not yet available.</Aside>

### Manual Installation

We provide pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Download from:

```
https://hel1.your-objectstorage.com/ricochet-cli/$VERSION/ricochet-$VERSION-$OS_ARCH.tar.gz
```

Available `$OS_ARCH` combinations:

- `aarch64` (Linux ARM64)
- `x86_64` (Linux x86)
- `windows.exe`

After downloading, extract and add to your PATH:

```sh
tar -xzf ricochet-$VERSION-$OS_ARCH.tar.gz
mv ricochet-$VERSION-$OS_ARCH/ricochet /usr/local/bin/
```

<Aside type="note">
  On Windows, execute the `.exe` file directly after extracting.
</Aside>

## Authentication

### Logging In

Use the `login` command with the `-S` flag to specify the server URL:

```bash
ricochet login -S https://try.ricochet.rs
```

This opens your browser to complete authentication. Once authenticated, your credentials are stored locally and used for subsequent commands.

### Multiple Instances

You can authenticate with multiple ricochet servers. Each server's credentials are stored separately, keyed by the server URL.

To switch between servers, specify the `-S` flag with your commands:

```bash
# Deploy to production
ricochet deploy -S https://ricochet.example.com

# Deploy to staging
ricochet deploy -S https://staging.ricochet.example.com
```

<Aside type="tip">
  If you only work with one server, you can set the `RICOCHET_SERVER`
  environment variable to avoid passing `-S` with every command.
</Aside>

### Logging Out

To remove stored credentials for a server:

```bash
ricochet logout -S https://try.ricochet.rs
```

## Deployment

### Basic Deployment

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
ricochet deploy
```

If no `_ricochet.toml` file exists, the CLI walks you through an interactive setup:

<Steps>

1. **Choose a language** — R, Julia, or Python

2. **Select content type** — Shiny, Plumber, Quarto, etc.

3. **Specify the entrypoint** — The file that starts your app (e.g., `app.R`)

4. **Name your content** — A display name visible in the ricochet UI

5. **Set visibility** — Private, Internal, or External

</Steps>

After completing setup, a `_ricochet.toml` file is created in your project directory.  
See [Using `_ricochet.toml`](/v0-1/user/deployment/2-ricochet-toml) for configuration details.

### Redeploying

Subsequent deployments use the existing `_ricochet.toml` configuration:

```bash
ricochet deploy
```
