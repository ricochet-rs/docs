**ricochet** is the deployment platform for data scientists.

Deploy R, Julia, and Python apps with a single command.
Built-in authentication, access controls, and scheduling let you focus on your work, not infrastructure.

## Why ricochet?

Putting R, Julia, and Python into production shouldn't be hard.
ricochet is a modern deployment platform tailored for data scientists who want to focus on their work, not infrastructure.

- **Flexible infrastructure**: Run on Kubernetes, Docker, or VMs. Your infrastructure choices don't dictate your costs or capabilities.
- **Built for teams of any size**: From individual homelabs to enterprise deployments, ricochet scales with you. Our homelab offering provides core features for personal projects, while enterprise features support production operations at scale.
- **Deploy anything that speaks HTTP**: Shiny, Plumber, Ambiorix, Dash.jl, you name it. If it speaks HTTP, you should be able to deploy it to ricochet. If we can't, [tell us](https://github.com/orgs/ricochet-rs/discussions/new?category=feature-requests) and we will work to make it possible.
- **Modern workflows**: Invoke tasks via REST API, schedule with cron, deploy via CLI or Git. Built-in authentication and access controls mean you can go from development to production without infrastructure headaches.
