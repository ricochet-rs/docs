title: Authentication

import { Aside, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

ricochet uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication.
This allows you to bring your own identity provider to ricochet.

## Requirements

Your OIDC provider must support:

- **Claims**: `email` and `profile`
- **Grant Type**: Authorization Code Flow

ricochet uses the subject identifier (`sub`) from your OIDC provider as the unique user ID.
The `email` claim is collected for future SMTP integrations.

## Configuration

Add the following to your `ricochet-config.toml`:

```toml
[auth.oidc]
issuer_url = "https://your-domain.auth0.com/"
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
redirect_url = "https://your-ricochet-domain.com/oauth/callback"
display_name_claim = "preferred_username"  # Optional, defaults to "preferred_username"
```

<Aside type="caution">
  The redirect URL **must** use the `/oauth/callback` path for compatibility
  with the ricochet cli.

#### Configuration Fields

| Field                | Required | Description                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `issuer_url`         | Yes      | Your OIDC provider's issuer URL. Must start with `https://`                                                    |
| `client_id`          | Yes      | OAuth client ID from your OIDC provider                                                                        |
| `client_secret`      | Yes      | OAuth client secret from your OIDC provider                                                                    |
| `redirect_url`       | Yes      | Callback URL where users are redirected after authentication. **Must be** `https://your-domain/oauth/callback` |
| `display_name_claim` | No       | OIDC claim to use for display name. Defaults to `preferred_username`                                           |

<Aside type="caution">
  Environment variables are useful for containerized deployments or sensitive
  credentials, but **TOML configuration is recommended** whenever possible as
  it's easier to manage and version control.
</Aside>

## Validation

ricochet validates your OIDC configuration on startup:

- The `issuer_url` must start with `https://`
- All required fields must be present
- The OIDC provider's discovery endpoint (`.well-known/openid-configuration`) must be accessible

If validation fails, ricochet will log an error and refuse to start.
