title: Tasks

Tasks are content items that run to completion, such as R/Julia/Python scripts and Quarto documents.
Unlike apps, tasks don't require an active runtime.

See the [content items overview](/v0-1/user/content-items/1-content-items-overview#tasks) for a complete list of supported task types.

- **[Scheduling Tasks](/v0-1/user/tasks/2-scheduling)** - Run tasks on a schedule
