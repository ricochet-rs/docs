Control who can access your deployed content using access types and collaborators.

## Access Types

Every content item has an access type that controls who can view it:

### Private

Only the item owner and specified collaborators can access the item.
Private items are ideal for:

- Work-in-progress applications
- Internal tools for specific teams
- Sensitive data or restricted content

### Internal

All logged-in users can view the item.
Internal items are useful for:

- Company-wide dashboards
- Team analytics
- Internal documentation

### External

Anyone can view the item without authentication.
External items are perfect for:

- Public-facing applications and APIs
- Demo applications

## Content Collaborators

For fine-grained access control, you can invite collaborators to individual content items.
Each collaborator has a specific role:

### Owner

The user who originally deployed the item.
Owners have full control:

- Manage all item settings
- Add or remove collaborators
- Delete the item
- Deploy updates

### Admin

Collaborator admins can manage the item:

- Modify all item settings
- Add or remove other collaborators
- Delete the item
- Cannot deploy updates (unless they're also a developer with deploy access)

### Editor

Editors can configure the item but have limited control:

- Modify item settings
- Cannot manage collaborators
- Cannot delete the item

### Contributor

Contributors can only deploy updates:

- Deploy new versions of the item
- Cannot modify settings
- Cannot manage collaborators

### Consumer

Consumers have read-only access:

- View the item and its content
- No modification privileges

## Setting Access and Permissions

1. Navigate to your item's settings page
2. Go to the "Access" section
3. Choose the access type
4. Add collaborators and assign their roles

<Aside type="tip">
  Start with `private` access while developing, then change to `internal` or
  `external` when ready to share.
