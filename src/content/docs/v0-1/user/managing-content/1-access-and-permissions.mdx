Control who can access your deployed content using access types and collaborators.

## Access Types

Every content item has an access type that controls who can view it:

- **Private**: Only the item owner and specified collaborators can access the item
- **Internal**: All logged-in users can view the item
- **External**: Anyone can view the item without authentication

## Content Collaborators

For fine-grained access control, you can invite collaborators to individual content items.
Each collaborator has a specific role:

- **Owner**: the user who deployed the item with full control
- **Admin**: can manage settings, collaborators, and delete the item
- **Editor**: can modify settings but cannot manage collaborators
- **Contributor**: can deploy updates only
- **Consumer**: read-only access

| Capability            | Owner | Admin | Editor | Contributor | Consumer |
| --------------------- | :---: | :---: | :----: | :---------: | :------: |
| View item             |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅   |     ✅      |    ✅    |
| Deploy updates        |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅   |     ✅      |    ❌    |
| Modify settings       |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ✅   |     ❌      |    ❌    |
| Manage collaborators  |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ❌   |     ❌      |    ❌    |
| Delete item           |  ✅   |  ✅   |   ❌   |     ❌      |    ❌    |
