title: User Roles
---

import { Aside, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Every user on a ricochet instance has one of three roles that determine their system-wide capabilities.

- **Admin**: can manage users and all server content
- **Developer**: can deploy items
- **Consumer**: can only view items

## Default User Role

When new users authenticate for the first time, they are assigned a default role.
The default role is **Developer**, but you can configure this to meet your organization's needs.

Add the following to your `ricochet-config.toml`:

```toml
[auth]
default_role = "consumer"
```

## Admin

Administrators have full control over the ricochet instance:

- Manage all content items on the server
- Configure server settings
- Manage all users and their roles
- Access all deployed items regardless of access permissions

Admins are responsible for:

- Initial server setup and configuration
- Managing OIDC authentication settings
- Assigning user roles

## Developer

Developers can create and manage their own content:

- Deploy items to ricochet using the CLI or Git
- Manage settings for items they own
- Collaborate on items they've been invited to
- View internal and external items

Developers cannot:

- Access other users' private items (unless added as a collaborator)
- Manage server settings
- Assign user roles

## Consumer

Consumers have view-only access:

- View items they have permission to access
- Cannot deploy or modify any items
- Cannot access private items unless explicitly granted access as a collaborator

Consumers are ideal for:

- Stakeholders who need to view dashboards and reports
- External users accessing public content
- Teams that consume data products without creating them

<Aside>
  User roles are separate from content-level collaborator roles.
  A developer
  might be an "owner" of one item and a "contributor" on another item.
</Aside>

## Assigning Roles

User roles are assigned by administrators through the ricochet admin interface.

**Initial Login**: When users authenticate for the first time via OIDC, they are automatically assigned the default role configured in your settings.

**Changing Roles**: Administrators can change user roles from the **Users** page `/users`, selecting the user, and changing their **Role**.

| Manage server       |  ✅   |    ❌     |    ❌    |
| Assign user roles   |  ✅   |    ❌     |    ❌    |
