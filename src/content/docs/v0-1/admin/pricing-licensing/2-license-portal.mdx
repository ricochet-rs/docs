The license portal at [portal.licensing.ricochet.rs](https://portal.licensing.ricochet.rs) provides a self-service dashboard for managing your Ricochet licenses.

## Features

In the portal you can:

- Purchase or renew licenses
- Update or change your current license tier
- View current usage and machine allocation
- Check license expiration dates

## Getting Access

You can either sign up to the license portal manually or wait until an account has been created for you (this is done automatically after a purchase).
