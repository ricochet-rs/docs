title: Content items
---

`ricochet` supports deploying R and Julia based content. Content items are categorize as either a **service** or an **invokable** item.

A **service** is one that requires an active runtime such as plumber or shiny.

An **invokable item** is one that runs to completion such as R/Julia scripts and Quarto documents.

All invokable items can be [scheduled](/scheduling) (or [invoked via API](/invocation)). A subset of invokable items can be served as a [**static html** website](/static)â€”for example R Markdown and Quarto documents or websites.
