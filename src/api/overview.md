Ricochet is built around a powerful REST API that lets you deploy content, manage settings, schedule tasks, and control running services. For R developers, we also provide an R SDK that wraps the API in a user-friendly interface.

Install the R SDK:

```r
remotes::install_url("https://docs.ricochet.rs/pkgs/ricochet-r.tar.gz")
```
The API reference explains each endpoint with examples using curl and R. For broader context—like content types, deployment models, and configuration—see the [general documentation](/overview).
