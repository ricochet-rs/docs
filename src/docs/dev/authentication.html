<p>ricochet uses open ID connect for authentication. This allows you to bring your own identity provider to ricochet.</p>
<p>ricochet requires that your OIDC provider is able to provide the <code>email</code> and <code>profile</code> claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>ricochet uses the subject identifier from your OIDC IDP as the user ID.</li>
<li>
<li>At present the <code>email</code> is unused but is collected for future integrations with an SMTP server.</li>
</ul>
