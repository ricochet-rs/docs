Ricochet uses a self-service pricing and licensing model.\
Licenses can be purchased, managed, and renewed **without** contacting sales.

## Editions

Ricochet is available in two editions:

- **Community Edition**: free to use with a subset of features, ideal for personal projects and small-scale deployments.
- **Enterprise Edition**: unlocks the full feature set including additional runtimes, higher resource limits, and priority support.

If you start with the Community Edition and upgrade to a licensed plan at any time.

## Pricing

An overview of all pricing options is available at [portal.ricochet.rs/pricing](https://portal.ricochet.rs/pricing).

[Paddle.com](https://paddle.com) acts as the Merchant of Record (MOR) for all transactions, handling billing, invoicing, and tax compliance on our behalf.
You can purchase a license in the currency of your choice.

## Licensing

Licenses are tied to individual Ricochet instances (machines).
Each license key activates a single instance, and usage is tracked through the license portal.
