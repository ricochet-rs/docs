title: Static Sites
---

Many tasks generate static HTML sites, such as Quarto (R, Julia, or Python) or R Markdown documents.
These static sites can be served alongside the content item itself using the `[static]` content settings in your `_ricochet.toml` file.

:::note[Known Limitation]
Static HTML settings can only be configured in the `_ricochet.toml` file prior to initial deployment or by using the `PATCH /api/v0/content/{item-id}/settings` API route.
:::

## Configuration

The `[static]` section supports the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `output_dir` | The directory to serve. |
| `index` | The file to serve from `output_dir`. Defaults to `index.html`. |

## Example

To serve an R Markdown website that renders to the `_site/` directory:

```toml
[static]
index = "index.html"
output_dir = "_site"
```

The site will be accessible at `/static/{item-id}` and will automatically redirect to the `index` path.
