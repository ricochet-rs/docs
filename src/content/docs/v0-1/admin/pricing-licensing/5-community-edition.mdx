The Community Edition is a fully functional version of Ricochet that is free to use.
It provides everything individuals need to publish and maintain their apps and tasks.

## Philosophy

A powerful Community Edition is important to us.
We believe there is a good middle ground between community and enterprise offerings: one where individual users get a complete, production-ready platform, and where teams get advanced sharing and security capabilities.

## What's Included

The Community Edition gives you access to:

- Deploying and managing apps and tasks
- SSO authentication
- Scheduling and task invocation
- CLI-based deployments

and will stay free forever, always 💜️
