## Community

About ricochet or anything else in the world!

Otherwise, you can open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/ricochet-rs/discussions) in our GitHub organisation.

## Why ricochet?

We are motivated by the idea to have an app that allows running and deploying any http-speaking dashboard and API in a central interface - for both homelab and corporate use.
The programming language which creates these using should not matter, neither should the environment (VM, k8s, docker).
