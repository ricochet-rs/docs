title: Authentication
---

ricochet uses open ID connect for authentication. This allows you to bring your own identity provider to ricochet.

ricochet requires that your OIDC provider is able to provide the `email` and `profile` claim.

- ricochet uses the subject identifier from your OIDC IDP as the user ID.
-
- At present the `email` is unused but is collected for future integrations with an SMTP server.
